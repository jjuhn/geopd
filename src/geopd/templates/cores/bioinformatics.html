    The Bioinformatics/Genomics core will integrate, disseminate, store and archive sequencing data generated by
    different GEoPD sites.

    Part of our objective is to develop a standardized analytical pipeline to seamlessly perform downstream
    genomic analyses, to use either next-generation sequencing data (exome, genome, resequencing) or candidate SNP data
    generated via different genotyping platforms. However, the Bioinformatics/Genomics core also serves to integrate
    data generated by different cores (i.e. Epidemiology core, Clinical core, Biology core) with raw genomic data. As
    such the Core will be responsible for developing and managing a “GEoPD database”, containing genomic data accessible
    to GEoPD members.

    The Bioinformatics/Genomics broader mission is to help GEoPD investigators perform novel, multi-dimensional,
    clinico-genetic-epidemiological studies.
