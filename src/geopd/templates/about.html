                        are maintained, their membership elected at annual meetings, and based on based on expertise and
                        need. Each core has a specific mandate about one of the following areas: bioinformatics,
                        biology, clinical, communications, epidemiology and statistics. Projects approved by the
                        steering committee are promoted, supported by the cores and participating global site

                        participation in research. We do not bypass clinician investigators by going “direct to

                    GEoPD Membership includes Site PIs and General Membership. The former
                    requires the Investigator to be able to contribute clinical data and
                    biospecimens (blood/DNA) from at least 100 patients with Parkinson's
                    disease and 100 controls* to specific, collaborative projects. The latter
                    can be all members of the same Institution, affiliated with the same
                    group/Site PI. All new Members are to apply to join through the GEoPD
                    website, and must nominate somebody from the Steering Committee to activate
                    their account privileges**. All Members from a site (at least) are
                    encouraged to join, see and contribute to on-line content and discussions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                    Site PIs can nominate and direct Projects (see
                    <a href="http://geopd.can.ubc.ca/projects/">
                        http://geopd.can.ubc.ca/projects/
                    </a>
                    ). New Projects can be nominated at any time. They are first vetted by the
                    Steering Committee, then put to the Membership to take part. Most Projects
                    have come through discussions at annual meetings, but may also be suggested
                    by writing to the Steering Committee at any time during the year (via the
                    GEOPD website or by direct email). Site PIs can also request short surveys
                    of the membership e.g. which sites have expertise in sleep disorders, or
                    might want to contribute to such research?

                    * Caution is exercised if the PI is from a rare/isolated population, as it
                    may be challenging but all the more necessary to obtain sufficient
                    controls. The number of controls may be relaxed for some Australasian,
                    Asian, US and European sites, given so many are in the public domain.
