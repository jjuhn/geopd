name	investigators	description
RVCD	Matthew Farrer	Many sites also conduct family studies, leading to the discovery of genes that cause familial PD. With next generation sequencing, we are uniquely positioned to make novel gene discoveries and provide hope for new therapies.
Courage PD	Manu Sharma,Rejko Kr√ºger,Alexis Elbaz	International collaboration between many sites with funding form the Joint Program on Neurodegenerative Disease (JPND). The project includes whole genome sequencing, custom array genotyping and focuses on genetic and environmental variables using a Mendelian randomization approach.
LONG-PD	Katerina Markopoulou	GEO-PD includes 20 sites from 14 countries and 4 continents who have committed to collect and share DNAs and clinical data longitudinally for 15 years, for 3,000 Parkinson's disease cases.
Monogenic-PD	Christine Klein	A genotype-phenotype correlation study of monogenic forms of parkinsonism including LRRK2, PINK1, Parkin etc.
